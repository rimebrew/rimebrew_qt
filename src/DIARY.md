GTK changed their APIs too fast, not gonna to use GTK.

GNOME is really viewing themselves as something big like Windows or macOS. Everything should look GNOME-y if you use GTK, and everything else must adopt the GNOME-y style if targeting GNOME.

Big applications, like GIMP, have to consume a huge amount of manpower for the GTK's API change.
